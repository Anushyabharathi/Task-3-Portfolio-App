DESCRIPTION:

The Personal Portfolio Website is a single-page responsive website designed to showcase a developer’s projects, skills, and contact information. The portfolio serves as a professional representation of the developer’s capabilities and achievements. It features a fixed navigation menu that allows visitors to quickly jump to sections such as Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The home section introduces the developer with a short bio and a call-to-action button to view projects. The project section highlights key projects with brief descriptions and links, while the skills section uses visually distinct tags to display the technologies the developer is proficient in. The contact section provides essential contact details and links to GitHub or LinkedIn profiles.

The website is fully responsive, ensuring proper display across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The UI design uses gradients, card layouts, and hover effects to create a modern, professional appearance. This project demonstrates frontend design skills, CSS styling, and the ability to create a clean, navigable interface without relying on external frameworks.
